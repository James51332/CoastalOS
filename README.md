# CoastalOS
A hobby OS I'm making to learn about operating systems and their development. 

## Why CoastalOS?

Operating system development has always been fascinating to me, but it's a very difficult and demanding area of computer science. I'm calling the system CoastalOS, because I'm on vacation at the beach at the time of writing. 

## Roadmap

I don't really know exactly where I want to take this operating system. But I want to have a plan for the structure before I begin to write any serious code. I setup a trello page, which I'll make public, when I'll make some more plans. I have a lot of reading to do. One thing that I do know, is that I'm not going to rush to reach userspace, or create a GUI library. While I aim to implement those things in the future, I hope to do a proper job implementing and documenting the features that I write.  

## Platform

I'm planning to write the operating system in C for x86, because it is the most accesssible and documented space to write for.
