# CoastalOS
A hobby OS I'm making to learn about operating systems and their development. 

## Why CoastalOS?

Operating system development has always been fascinating to me, but it's a very difficult and demanding area of computer science. I'm calling the system CoastalOS, because I'm on vacation at the beach at the time of writing. 

## Roadmap

I don't really know exactly where I want to take this operating system. But I want to have a plan for the structure before I begin to write any serious code. I setup a [trello page](https://trello.com/b/xVDxlLAj/coastalos), which has a few different tasks that I want to begin with. I have a lot of reading to do. One thing that I do know, is that I'm not going to rush to reach userspace, or create a GUI library. While I aim to implement those things in the future, I hope to do a proper job implementing and documenting the features that I write.  

## Platform

I'm planning to write the operating system in C for x86, because it is the most accesssible and documented space to write for. The operating system would be most easily developed from Linux, but I'm using a Mac as my daily driver, so for now, that's all I've written build scripts for. Linux should be easy to get up and running though if it serves useful.
